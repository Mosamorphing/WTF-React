# Markup with JSX

HTML is a markup language used to annotate and give structure to text or data in a way that computers can understand and process. `Tags` are used to define elements and their attributrs. JSX is a syntax extensuon for Javascript that allows you to write HTML-like element inside JavaScript code. So, basically, JSX are Javascript code written in the guise of HTML.

If you wonder why this is essential, it is because the web is built on HTML, styled in CSS and given responsivity with Javascript. So, HTML is the bedrock of the Web. It houses the content but as the Web developed and changed from being static to being dynamic with Javascript, more interactivity was required and this is why in React, both content (HTML) and interactivity (JavaScript) can be written in the same JSX file.
